# water-quality
This repo is intended as a home for any scripts or analytical methods that could be of use in accessing, reformatting, or picking apart water quality data from open sources such as USGS National Water Information Service (NWIS), the Water Quality Portal (https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide/#table-7-sample-results-physicalchemical-result-retrieval-metadata), or NOAA. Whenever possible, I will aim to use publicly accessible tools and illustrate what is being done to manipulate and reshape data.

A tool that is not included in this package but is frequently used in order to properly format datasources is ogr2ogr from the gdal package. This tool easily converts between shapefiles, geojsons, and other geospatial data formats of interest.
